<p> In the world of motorsports, there are the official, corporate-sponsored affairs, like Nascar and Indycar, and then there are homegrown efforts–the ones that require only a souped-up car and a lot of empty asphalt. In backwoods America, that might take the form of demolition derbies or drag racing. In places like United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, it’s a type of street-racing called hajwalah.


Most people here in the U.S. know hajwalah, or “Arab drifting,” from insane YouTube videos about it, or from the background of M.I.A’s 2012 “Bad Girl” video. But as photographer Peter Garritano recently discovered, Arab drifters have a huge Instagram presence as well. Last March, Garritano reached out to some of these hajwalah Instagram accounts to see if he could photograph the drivers. His resulting series, Hajwalah, originally spotted by It’s Nice That, gives a glimpse inside the underground, adrenaline-fueled culture, and how it’s beginning to change.

Hajwalah was started by young men in Saudia Arabia in the 1970s, and has since spread to other Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates. That’s where Garritano went to shoot his series, first to Abu Dhabi, the country’s capital, and then to more rural places like Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain, where racers have more space and less risk of interaction with cops (fastcomapny).</p>
